Network Structure Project
Description
This project involves the creation of a network structure using Cisco Packet Tracer. The primary objective is to design and simulate a functional network, demonstrating key networking concepts and configurations. This network structure includes various devices such as routers, switches, PCs, and servers, interconnected to form a cohesive and operational network.

Tools and Technologies Used
Cisco Packet Tracer: A powerful network simulation tool used for designing, configuring, and testing network scenarios.
Routers and Switches: Fundamental network devices used to route and switch data between different segments of the network.
End Devices: PCs and servers representing the client and server endpoints in the network.
Protocols: Various networking protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, DHCP, DNS) configured to ensure proper communication and functionality within the network.
Topology Design: Creation of network topology diagrams to visually represent the network layout and connections.
Key Features
Comprehensive network design with multiple interconnected devices.
Configuration of networking protocols and services.
Simulation of real-world networking scenarios and troubleshooting.
